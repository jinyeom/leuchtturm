    "It is time. Ever since my first laptop printed `Hello, world!` -- which is far too long ago -- making my computer understand natural languages has been in my computer science bucket list. I'm certain this notebook won't even be close to that, but it sure is a start. Another motivation for this notebook is to clarify a few doubts and questions I have had regarding the current state of NLP. We'll get to that as we go deeper with this notebook."

    "One thing to keep in mind is, as the title of the notebook suggests, our main focus is to use neural networks for probabilistic model of natural languages in a continuous vector space. Just as in any other neural network applications, this is going to require statistical learning from a large set of data. Naturally, our choice of representation of meaning (or semantics) has to be based on some probability. **[Distributional Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics#Distributional_Hypothesis)** states just that: *words that are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar meanings*."
